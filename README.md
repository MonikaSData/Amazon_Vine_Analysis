Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews
- Use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin

Deliverable 2: Determine Bias of Vine Reviews
- Use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members in the toys reviews dataset

Deliverable 3: A Written Report on the Analysis
- Write a summary of the analysis

## Overview of the analysis
Using PySpark we will determine if there is any bias towards reviews that were written as part of the Vine program. For this analysis, we will determine if having a paid Vine review makes a difference in the percentage of 5-star reviews.

## Results
Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

**How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?**

**How many Vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**

**What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?**

## Summary
 In your summary, state if there is any positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program. Use the results of your analysis to support your statement. Then, provide one additional analysis that you could do with the dataset to support your statement.
